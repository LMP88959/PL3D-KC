NOTE: The macOS version is not guaranteed to work without issues.
Though the application was originally developed on a Mac,
I haven't tested it on other machines so I can't guarantee it'll run.

Please install XQuartz from:
https://www.xquartz.org

Verify the installation by checking for the existence of this file:
/opt/X11/lib/libXext.6.dylib

====================================================================

The X11 backend tries to utilize the MIT-SHM extension for faster video updating.

macOS by default has low shared memory limits which prevent us from having
accelerated graphics for framebuffers larger than (typically) 4MB in size.

In order to address this issue we must change these limits in the kernel.

As per this guide:
https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/doc/users_guide/2015.1/SharedMemory.html

As user 'root', create the file /etc/sysctl.conf
and add lines similar to those below:

kern.sysv.shmmax=67108864
kern.sysv.shmmin=1
kern.sysv.shmmni=128
kern.sysv.shmseg=32
kern.sysv.shmall=131072

Make sure shmmax is divisible by 4096 otherwise some versions of macOS will
reject the value.

Reboot your Mac and then you should have the ability to access much more shared
memory.
